    Fans rule the game, even though the players are the once who made all the fun. During 2022 season of NFL, the fans had shown their interest in their favorite players. While touchdowns were pretty important for QB, RB, and WRs moments to be liked by
    their fans, in general there were more Non TD moments than TD moments being sold during this season. However, resulting in a touchdown shows an increase in volume and specially average price of that moment than non touchdowns. 
    Specially in rushing moments we saw that some players do had their moments sold regardless of being a non touchdown and also in a losing, probably they were either fan favorites but unfortunately in a poor performing team?. All in all it's quite clear that
    performances which help their own teams victory make precious moments that fans would love to through their money at.
